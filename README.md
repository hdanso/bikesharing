## Analysis Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to determine whether a bike sharing program in Des Moines is a feasile business proposal to pursue. Data taken from the NYC Citibike program for the month of August was used as a proxy for bike sharing data, and as a means to determine whether the program would be profitable in Des Moines.

## Results - Using the visualizations you have in your Tableau Story, describe the results of each visualization underneath the image.
NYC Citibikes were used a total of 2,344,224 times within the month of August, with more than three-quartes of all users being subscribers (repeat users) vs. one time customers.

Peak riding times took place between 5-7pm, with most of the riders using bikes at 5pm.

In terms of trip duration, most bike trips during the month of August lasted between 0-20 minutes. Trip durations falling between 0-20 minutes was consistent across all genders (male, female, and unknown).

Looks at checkout data, the highest number of trips by weekday per hour is on Thursdays at 6pm. This is especially true for male bike users; over 30,000 bikes were checked out on Thursdays at 6pm by male users.

Finally, looking at the visualization outlining the user trips by gender, by weekday we can see again that most male subscriber users tend to ride bikes on Thursdays. Ths same is true for female bike subscribers, however, their usage is more evenly spread out throughout the week than male subscriber users.

## Summary - Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional visualizations that you would perform with the given dataset.
Overall the results observed with NYC Citibike data shows a promising future for a bike sharing program in Des Moines. With riders in the millions, and most being subscriber (repeat) users, there is an opportunity for the program to be popular and sustainable in Des Moines as well. Knowing that a vast majority of users are male could be used to influence marketing tactics, which could also work to further boost the popularity of the program. Finally, knowing the peak checkout times and weekdays can help program managers to ensure an optimal number of bikes are available for rental.

In addition to the visualization included in this report, additional visualizations that can be added to enhance this analysis include a visualization to show there the most popular start locations are (in order to plan for what locations should have extra bikes on site), as well as which start station locations are popular amongst subscriber users.
